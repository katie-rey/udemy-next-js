Why React

It is a client side javascript library
Better user experience
Reduced latency

JS - imperative approach (step by step)
React - Declaritive approach, splitting into smaller components

Angular - has more fetures, using Typescript, can be overkill for small projects
Vue - Includes most core features, not as popular

Nested paths and file based routing

- can create a folder inside other folders with either an index,js file or a nested file with another name

Dynamic Paths

- [] square brackets allow you to add dynamic paths
  next will always check for static files first when a url is entered, then will use the dynamic path

- [...] path = a catch all values that appear in the query. These will appear as elements in an array

PROS of using Next.js

- No extra boilerplate as with react-router
- Intuitive
- File and folder structure influences routes
